* Information problem:
    - Our information problem will be presented as an issue of organization. 
    - The information needed is available to students but the display and organization of the information is not in the best form to immediately address students' information needs.
    - What our solution aims to do is have all the PlanetTerp API data searchable and filterable in an easy to navigate and meaningful way that eases the student registration process.

* Stakeholders/target browsers:
    - Students, faculty, and new incoming students to the University of Maryland

* Data used:
    - Professor and Course Information from PlanetTerp

* Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem:
    - We will implement a search feature that searches for either a course and the professors that teach it or a professor and the courses taught by that professor. Users also will be able to filter the general list of courses by department, credits, and professors. The strongest feature of concern, Average Grade, can be viewed and visualized from all the previously mentioned searches and filters. The Average grade can also be filtered to represent all semesters or solely the semesters from the previous academic calendar year.


* Technical system decision rationale 
    - Our solution incorporates the three following Views:

        - Main View: They user would type in the search bar found in this view, press the search button, and get information about the course or professor they are looking for. This view is designed to be as simple as possible while providing the user with the information they need.

        - Advance Search View: They user is presented with more options for search. These are meant to make the user search more accurate, saving the user some time in the process.

        - Results View: This view filters the information searched by semester. This is meant to make the user search even more accurate by providing the correct timeline for the course/professor searched.


    - How/if your final system helps to address the problem:
        - We address the problem by providing our stakeholders with a website where they can efficiently get all the course, grade, and professor informaiton they need. We provide them with the choice of filtering through most of their searches; whether it is on course, grade, or professor, users will be able to filter the information they need with ease.

    - Challenges faced and impact on final design: 
        - One of the main challenges we faced was incorporating the search feature into our app. It took us some trial and error to achieve it. At the beginning, it was only capable of searching AASP courses. That took us some time to fix but when we did, the search was fully capable of searching for any course in the database

    - Possible future work directions with this problem:
        - Possible future work for this project include:
            - More stylish UI design
            - More information about grades. That is, grades per semester taught.
            - Recent professor reviews
